### What I learned

I learned about CSS custom properties (-- variables) and SCSS variables ($ variables). Previously, I only used SCSS variables and wasn't aware of the difference between SCSS variables and custom properties. I mistakenly thought they were the same.

I have also been learning about hsl and hsla colors. Additionally, I have learned how to create gradient colors using linear-gradient().
